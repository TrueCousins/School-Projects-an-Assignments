# Course Description
Further applications of programming techniques, introducing the fundamental concepts of data structures and algorithms. 
Topics include recursion, fundamental data structures (including stacks, queues, linked lists, hash tables, trees, and graphs),
and algorithmic analysis. Includes comprehensive programming projects. Programming language of choice is Java.

# Program List and Description


| Program    | Description          | 
| ------------- |:-------------| 
| Assignment1      | A simple program that calculates the minimum run way length for a plane when given user input for speed and acceleration. | 
| Assignment2      | A program that displays the first 100 palindromic prime numbers. | 
| Assignment3      | A program that calculates a number through the quadratic formula. User input needed for a, b, and c.| 
| Assignment4      | This program asks the user to enter a file name and displays the occurence of each letter in the file. | 
| Assignment5      | A program that demonstrates the Comparable and Cloneable interfaces by cloning the object Octagon and then comparing the two interfaces | 
| Assignment6      | A program used to demonstrate recursion. Asks the user to enter a string. The program will then find all the permutations of that string and display it. | 
| Assignment7      | An O(n) program that prompts the user to enter a sequenece of integers ending with 0 and finds the longest subsequence with the same number| 
| ExtraCredit1      | A program that has a recursive method that returns the number of the uppercase letters in a string.    |  
| ExtraCredit2 | Write a program that reads words from a text file and displays all the words (duplicates allowed) in ascending alphabetical order. The text file is passed as a command-line argument.      |
