# Purpose

This was a group project of six people. The purpose of this project was to simulate an Agile methodolgy with our professor as our client. We had two week sprints and report what we had done each sprint.  

# My role 

In the group, my role was Leader and Organizer. I helped keep the team on track, to stay on schedule, and assigned tasks to each member. Since we had a large group, I would assign goals for each sprint. 
# Planning

Originally, our code was just going to be one game, Mastermind. Later, our professor asked for more games, so we added two more games in the design. 

# Code Description

A Java program that allows a user to choose between three different games to play: 
    ..*MasterMind
    ..*Tic-Tac-Toe
    ..*Hangman
Each game is console based and does not have any graphics integrated into them. Our professor did not want people in the class to focus on graphics, but more on the lifecycle of creating a project. 
## H2 MasterMind
## H2 Tic-Tac-Toe
A user is able to play against an AI player.

## H2 Hangman
The program randomly picks out a word from a dictionary for the user to guess the letters and word given
