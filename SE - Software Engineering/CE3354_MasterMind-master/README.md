# Purpose

This was a group project of six people. The purpose of this project was to simulate an Agile methodolgy with our professor as our client. We had two week sprints and report what we had done each sprint.  

# My role 

In the group, my role was Leader and Organizer. I helped keep the team on track, to stay on schedule, and assigned tasks to each member. Since we had a large group, I would assign goals for each sprint. 
# Planning

Originally, our code was to create one game, Mastermind. Later, our professor, as our client, asked for more games. This allowed us to expect changes in Agile, so we changed the design and structure of our code and added two more games. 

# Code Description

A Java program that allows a user to choose between three different games to play: 
    ..*MasterMind
    ..*Tic-Tac-Toe
    ..*Hangman
Each game is console based and does not have any graphics integrated into them. Our professor did not want people in the class to focus on graphics, but more on the lifecycle of creating a project. 
## MasterMind
The game simulates the coding game, MasterMind. It randomly generates a pattern for the user to guess what the pattern is. The user has 12 tries to guess right and the game indicates if the user is getting closer or farther from the generated code.
## Tic-Tac-Toe
A user is able to play against an AI player.

## Hangman
The program randomly picks out a word from a dictionary for the user to guess the letters and word given. Depending on how many letters in the word, the program will adjust and give you less guesses than the total amount of letters.
